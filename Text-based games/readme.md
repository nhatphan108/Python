# Text-based game
Tic-tac-toe, Hangman and blackjack are  text-based games I made during my first my first 3 months of coding. Python code of these games utilizes loops, conditions, functions and basic data structures in Python ( Dictionary, Set, Lists ..)

## How to play
The game is made in a way that it is straightforward to everyone. 
The only thing you need to do is turn the game on and play away !!
