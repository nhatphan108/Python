# Web Scraper
By utilizing Beautifulsoup and Pandas libraries, I made an application to extract data from any 21RealEsate website that you desire
## Instructions
Inititate the app. Go to Residential Real Estate Website 21 at 

https://www.century21.com/?&utm_campaign=PaidSearchEnglish&utm_medium=PaidSearchEnglish&utm_source=google&utm_term=21st%2520century%2520real%2520estate&gclid=Cj0KCQiAnuDTBRDUARIsAL41eDq1trkukC3W2Hsm3LA6jfxm0xkIc4AZ23_1J2pW7Jir3PNg5gvIEegaAiYeEALw_wcB


Enter the location at which you want to look for houses. Click Search C21. When the website is loaded, copy the URL and paste it into the Application. Check the datas you want to extract from the site. Hit the extract data button. 1 second later an Excel file with all the document on the web will be in the document in which you put your app.
