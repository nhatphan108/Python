# Website Blocker
By using my file manipulation skils and my knowledge of GUI Tkinter, this is an app that will prevent users from accessing certain websites during a designated amount of time
## Warning/ Limitations
For the sake for demonstration of file manipulating skills, the data of website is stored in a file rather than a database in a real-world 
application. Therefore, the application is really local

Since the application messes with the hosts file which requires administrator privileges, there might be warning from firewall and even detections by anti-malware application.

The location of the hostsfile is different depending on your operating system. Therefore if you use a Mac, you have to change the path in the backend file :"/private/etc/hosts"

## How to use
To start the program, run Application.py.
As for the interface itself, the application is made in a way that it is straightforward to the user. You add and delete websites by using buttons. To set the desginated time, edit the To and From box from the application and save Time. To execute the program, hit "Execute the program" to get the script running.
Now that you have executed the program, no more worries about getting distracted and code away.
